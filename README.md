### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Giuliano Franca, I'm Character TD from Brazil who loves what I do. I started with graphic design in 2012, was a web designer freelancer for 2 years when I discovered my passion for animation. My first contact with 3D came right after when I did three specialized courses in animation and computer graphics fields and, since then, I fell in love with character rigging. Soon after that I started studying Python and C++ by myself making some tools for Autodesk Maya in order to improve my work. Was a post production trainee for 6 months and currently I'm working as freelancer. I do character rigging, prop rigging and tools development both in Python and C++ for advertising movies and short films always focused on improving my work and doing my best for my clients.
